Testing account: 
email: email@gmail.com
password: password 

API: MongoDB + Expressjs + Nodejs
How to run: npm run dev
PORT: 8080


front: Reactjs + Material UI
How to run: npm start 
PORT: 3000

MongoDB collection: Contact
mongodb+srv://email:G7ZI8GxENy7YY1pb@cluster0.9esca.mongodb.net/Contact?retryWrites=true&w=majority

How it works: 
In the API folder, I made a server that connect to a MongoDB database.
In the front folder, I made the Front that fetch, update and delete data using the API.

Features:
1. Authentication: 
    Use testing account to sign in, the request will be sent to http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login.
    The request will return with user data and a token with 2 hours expiry date.
    Currently, the signup page is not creating any users, but you can check the http files located at API/http-request
2. Creating contact: POST
    New contact are being created and added to the API endpoint: http://localhost:8080/api/contacts/add.
    For image uploading, the API is using https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer and uploading single images to the public folder.
    When new contact are created, the resulting id is then be added to the user contacts list.
3. Updating contact: PUT
    Contact are updated by using the API endpoint: http://localhost:8080/api/contact/edit/:id
    The id of the contact will be used to fetch the Contact and update its contents. 
4. Deleting contact: DELETE
    Contact are deleted by using the API endpoint: http://locahost:8080/api/contact/delete/:userId/:id
    The function in charge of the deletion will use the id to delete the contact from the database and remove the reference id from the user contact list.
5. Sharing contact: POST
    The function in charge to sending contact number from one user to another is using the endpoint: http://localhost:8080/api/contact/share
    The id of the receiver and the data being sent are in the body request.
