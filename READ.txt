Testing account: 
email: email@gmail.com
password: password 

API: MongoDB + Expressjs + Nodejs
How to run: npm run dev
PORT: 8080


front: Reactjs + Material UI
How to run: npm start 
PORT: 3000


How it works: 
In the API folder, I made a server that connect to a MongoDB database.
In the front folder, I made the Front that fetch, update and delete data using the API.

Features:
1. Authentication: 
    Use testing account to sign in, the request will be sent to http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login.
    The request will return with user data and a token with 2 hours expiry date.
    Currently, the signup page is not creating any users, but you can check the http files located at API/http-request
2. Creating contacts:
    Data are being fetched from http://localhost:8080/api/users/:id, with id being the identification of the current user.
